# Snakemake workflow: quantum-monte-carlo
This workflow performs a quantum monte carlo (QMC) calculation using "trial" wave function (WFN)
generated by QCHEM and ORCA.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install workflow and additional utilities

Download workflow from [repository](https://github.com/Konjkov/snakerules)
Download [molden2qmc.py](https://github.com/Konjkov/molden2qmc) utility required to convert "trial" WFN from MOLDEN output format to CASINO input format.
Download [multideterminant.py](https://github.com/Konjkov/molden2qmc) utility required to convert multi determinant information available in CASSCF and post-HF methods to CASINO format.
Copy them to the directory in the current path.
Choose program to generate "trial" WFN (QCHEM > 4.0 or ORCA 4.0.1) and install it.


### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the file `ORCA/Snakefile` or `QCHEM/Snakefile` depending on what program you will use.

The basic information necessary for calculations is contained in global variables:

* MOLECULES is a list of molecular geometry file names in xyz-format (without extension) located in the `chem_database` directory for which the calculation will be performed.

* METHODS is a list of quantum chemistry methods to obtain a "trial" WFN.

* BASES is a list of bases in which the trial function will be represented.

* JASTROW_RANKS is a filename of template (without extension) defining JASTROW factor

Depending on the program used to generate "trial" WFN, the following rules are available:

* ORCA
    * ALL_ORCA rule
    * ALL_VMC rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT_ENERGY rule
    * ALL_VMC_DMC rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT_BF rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT_ENERGY_BF rule
    * ALL_VMC_DMC_BF rule

* QCHEM
    * ALL_QCHEM rule
    * ALL_VMC rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT_ENERGY rule
    * ALL_VMC_DMC rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT_BF rule
    * ALL_VMC_OPT_ENERGY_BF rule
    * ALL_VMC_DMC_BF rule

### Step 3: Execute workflow

All you need to execute this workflow is to install Snakemake via the [Conda package manager](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#installation-via-conda). Software needed by this workflow is automatically deployed into isolated environments by Snakemake.

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake <rule> -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake <rule>
