# Snakemake workflow: quantum-monte-carlo
This workflow performs a quantum monte carlo (QMC) calculation using "trial" wave function (WFN)
generated by QCHEM and ORCA.

## Authors

* Vladimir Konjkov

## Usage

### Step 1: Install workflow and additional utilities

* Download and extract the [latest commit from master branch](https://github.com/Konjkov/snakerules)
* Download [molden2qmc.py and multideterminant.py](https://github.com/Konjkov/molden2qmc) utilities required to convert "trial" WFN from QCHEM and ORCA output to CASINO input format. Copy them to the directory in the current path.
* Choose program to generate "trial" WFN (QCHEM > 4.0 or ORCA 4.0.1) and install it.

### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the file `ORCA/Snakefile` or `QCHEM/Snakefile` depending on what program you will use.

### Step 3: Execute workflow

All you need to execute this workflow is to install Snakemake via the [Conda package manager](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#installation-via-conda). Software needed by this workflow is automatically deployed into isolated environments by Snakemake.

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake <rule> -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake <rule>
